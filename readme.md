# Loaders

Lightweight loaders & spinners for your next React project.

- **24 Types üé®** ‚Äî Unique enough to be interesting; simple enough to use in real-world projects
- **Customizable üñåÔ∏è** ‚Äî Set the size, color, line weight and animation speed to match your design
- **Tiny ü¶ê** ‚Äî Individual loaders are < 1kb gzipped
- **No gifs üì∑** ‚Äî Built with HTML and modern CSS. A couple loaders use lightweight SVG as well
- **Zero dependencies ‚õìÔ∏è** ‚Äî Zero worries.

Visit the [üåê Website](https://uiball.com/loaders) to see them all in action.

Built by [Griffin Johnston](https://twitter.com/griffinjohnston) for [UI Ball](https://uiball.com)

## Installation

**NPM**

```jsx
npm install @uiball/loaders
```

**Yarn**

```jsx
yarn add @uiball/loaders
```

## Getting Started

Import individual loader components. Use them wherever you like. The full list can be found on [the website](https://uiball.com/loaders).

```jsx
import { Waveform } from '@uiball/loaders'

export default function PageSection({ isLoading }) {
  return (
    <div aria-live="polite" aria-busy={isLoading}>
      {isLoading && <Waveform />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Tree Shaking

This package is designed to maximize the benefits of [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking); so when you use a modern bundler like Webpack, Rollup or Parcel, and `import { Orbit } from '@uiball/loaders'` only the tiny code for the Orbit loader ends up in your app (most are less than 1kb).

## Platform Support

This is a pure ESM library, so no `require()`-ing from CommonJS.

Next.js versions less than 12 don't transpile ESM modules by default and will throw an error. If you are using Next v11.1, you can add support with an [experimental flag](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11-1#es-modules-support). Otherwise you can add support with this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules.

Loaders make use of CSS custom properties (CSS variables) and keyframe animations, which work great in all modern browsers. Internet Explorer is not supported, however.

## Options

_Each loader has different defaults. You can see them on [the website](https://uiball.com/loaders). Click on an individual loader and open the "source" sidebar. Default values will be listed at the top, followed by HTML and CSS if you want to copy/paste rather than use the React components._

### `size: number`

The size of the loader. Specifically, this defines the largest dimension (height or width) in pixels.

```jsx
<Ring size={35} />
```

### `color: string`

Any valid CSS color value is accepted, so `#000000`, `red`, `hsl(13, 68%, 63%)` and `var(--my-custom-color)` are all a-okay.

```jsx
<Ring color="papayawhip" />
```

### `speed: number`

The speed of the animation. Each loader uses this number a little differently (individual parts of a given loader might have different timings), but in general this number represents the duration of a single full animation loop in seconds, so smaller = faster.

```jsx
<Ring speed={1.75} />
```

### `lineWeight: number`

The width / stroke in pixels of line-based loaders like `<Waveform />` or `<RaceBy />`. You can see if an individual loader supports this property on [the website](https://uiball.com/loaders).

```jsx
<Ring lineWeight={3.5} />
```
